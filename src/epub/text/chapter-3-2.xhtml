			</hgroup>
			<p>“How much do you know of our scheme?” asked Tiel.</p>
			<p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>
			<p>“Merely that you were going to impersonate a clergyman who was due to come here and preach this next Sunday. How you were going to achieve this feat I wasn’t told.”</p>
			<p>He leaned back in his chair and sucked at his pipe, and then he began his story with a curious detached air, as though he were surveying his own handiwork from the point of view of an impartial connoisseur.</p>
			<p>“The idea was distinctly ingenious,” said he, “and I think I may also venture to claim for it a little originality. I won’t trouble you with the machinery by which we learn things. It’s enough to mention that among the little things we did learn was the fact that the minister of this parish had left for another charge, and that the parishioners were choosing his successor after the Scottish custom⁠—by hearing a number of candidates each preach a trial sermon.” He broke off and asked, “Do you happen to have heard of Schumann?”</p>
			<p>“You don’t mean the great Schumann?”</p>
			<p>“I mean a certain gentleman engaged in the same quiet line of business as myself. He is known of course under another name in England, where he is considered a very fine specimen of John Bull at his best⁠—a jovial, talkative, commercial gentleman with nice spectacles like <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pickwick, who subscribes to all the war charities and is never tired of telling his friends what he would do with the Kaiser if he caught him.”</p>
			<p>I laughed aloud at this happy description of a typical John Bull.</p>
			<p>“Well,” he continued, “I suggested to Schumann the wild idea⁠—as it seemed to us at first⁠—of getting into the islands in the guise of a candidate for the parish of Myredale. Two days later Schumann came to me with his spectacles twinkling with excitement.</p>
			<p>“ ‘Look at this!’ said he.</p>
			<p>“He showed me a photograph in an illustrated paper. It was the portrait of a certain <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Alexander Burnett, minister of a parish in the south of Scotland, and I assure you that if the name ‘Adolph Tiel’ had been printed underneath, none of my friends would have questioned its being my own portrait.</p>
			<p>“ ‘The stars are fighting for us!’ said Schumann.</p>
			<p>“ ‘They seem ready to enlist,’ I agreed.</p>
			<p>“ ‘How shall we encourage them?’ said he.</p>
			<p>“ ‘I shall let you know tomorrow,’ I said.</p>
			<p>“I went home and thought over the problem. From the first I was convinced that the only method which gave us a chance of success was for this man Burnett to enter voluntarily as a candidate, make all the arrangements himself⁠—including the vital matter of a passport⁠—and finally start actually upon his journey. Otherwise, no attempt to impersonate him seemed to me to stand any chance of success.</p>
			<p>“Next day I saw Schumann and laid down these conditions, and we set about making preliminary inquiries. They were distinctly promising. Burnett’s parish was a poor one, and from what we could gather, he had already been thinking for some time past of making a change.</p>
			<p>“We began by sending him anonymously a paper containing a notice of the vacancy here. That of course was just to set him thinking about it. The next Sunday Schumann motored down to his parish, saw for himself that the resemblance to me was actually quite remarkable, and then after service made the minister’s acquaintance. Imagine the good <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burnett’s surprise and interest when this pleasant stranger proved to be intimately acquainted with the vacant parish of Myredale, and described it as a second Garden of Eden! Before they parted Schumann saw that the fish was hooked.</p>
			<p>“The next problem was how to make the real Burnett vanish into space, and substitute the false Burnett without raising a trace of suspicion till my visit here was safely over. Again luck was with us. We sent an agent down to make inquiries of his servant a few days before he started, and found that he was going to spend a night with a friend in Edinburgh on his way north.”</p>
			<p>Tiel paused to knock the ashes out of his pipe, and I remarked⁠—</p>
			<p>“At first sight I confess that seems to me to complicate the problem. You would have to wait till Burnett had left Edinburgh, wouldn’t you?”</p>
			<p>Tiel smiled and shook his head.</p>
			<p>“That is what we thought ourselves at first,” said he, “but our second thoughts were better. What do you think of a wire to Burnett from his friend in Edinburgh telling him that a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Taylor would call for him in his motorcar: plus a wire to the friend in Edinburgh from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burnett regretting that his visit must be postponed?”</p>
			<p>“Excellent!” I laughed.</p>
			<p>“Each wire, I may add, contained careful injunctions not to reply. And I may also add that the late <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burnett was simplicity itself.”</p>
			<p>I started involuntarily.</p>
			<p>“The ‘late’ <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burnett! Do you mean⁠—”</p>
			<p>“What else could one do with him?” asked Tiel calmly. “Both Schumann and I believe in being thorough.”</p>
			<p>Of course this worthy pair were but doing their duty. Still I was glad to think they had done their dirty work without my assistance. It was with a conscious effort that I was able to ask calmly⁠—</p>
			<p>“How did you manage it?”</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Taylor, with his car and his chauffeur, called at the manse. The chauffeur remained in the car, keeping his face unostentatiously concealed. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Taylor enjoyed the minister’s hospitality till the evening had sufficiently fallen. Then we took him to Edinburgh by the coast road.”</p>
			<p>Tiel paused and looked at me, as though to see how I was enjoying the gruesome tale. I am afraid I made it pretty clear that I was not enjoying it in the least. The idea of first partaking of the wretched man’s hospitality, and then coolly murdering him, was a little too much for my stomach. Tiel, however, seemed rather amused than otherwise with my attitude.</p>
			<p>“We knocked him on the head at a quiet part of the road, stripped him of every stitch of clothing, tied a large stone to his feet, and pitched him over the cliff,” he said calmly.</p>
			<p>“And his clothes⁠—,” I began, shrinking back a little in my chair.</p>
			<p>“Are these,” said Tiel, indicating his respectable-looking suit of black.</p>
			<p>Curiously enough this was the only time I heard the man tell a tale of this sort, and in this diabolical, deliberate, almost flippant way. It was in marked contrast to his usually brief, concise manner of speaking. Possibly it was my reception of his story that discouraged him from exhibiting this side of his nature again. I certainly made no effort to conceal my distaste now.</p>
			<p>“Thank God, I am not in the secret service!” I said devoutly.</p>
			<p>“I understand you are in the submarine service,” said Tiel in a dry voice.</p>
			<p>“I am⁠—and I am proud of it!”</p>
			<p>“Have you never fired a torpedo at an inoffensive merchant ship?”</p>
			<p>“That is very different!” I replied hotly.</p>
			<p>“It is certainly more wholesale,” said he.</p>
			<p>I sprang up.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Tiel,” I said, “kindly understand that a German naval officer is not in the habit of enduring affronts to his service!”</p>
			<p>“But you think a German secret-service agent should have no such pride?” he inquired.</p>
			<p>“I decline to discuss the question any further,” I said stiffly.</p>
			<p>For a moment he seemed exceedingly amused. Then he saw that I was in no humour for jesting on the subject, and he ceased to smile.</p>
			<p>“Have another cigar?” he said, in a quiet matter-of-fact voice, just as though nothing had happened to ruffle the harmony of the evening.</p>
			<p>“You quite understand what I said?” I demanded in an icy voice.</p>
			<p>“I thought the subject was closed,” he replied with a smile, and then jumping up he laid his hand on my arm in the friendliest fashion. “My dear Belke,” said he, “we are going to be shut up together in this house for several days, and if we begin with a quarrel we shall certainly end in murder. Let us respect one another’s point of view, and say no more about it.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t know what you mean by ‘one another’s point of view,’ ” I answered politely but coldly. “So far as I am aware there is only one point of view, and I have just stated it. If we both respect that, there will be no danger of our quarrelling.”</p>
			<p>He glanced at me for a moment in an odd way, and then said merely⁠—</p>
			<p>“Well, are you going to have another cigar, or would you like to go to bed?”</p>
			<p>“With your permission I shall go to bed,” I said.</p>
			<p>He conducted me through the hall and down the passage that led to the back premises. At the end rose a steep and narrow stair. We ascended this, and at the top found a narrow landing with a door at either end of it.</p>
			<p>“This is your private flat,” he explained in a low voice. “The old house, you will see, has been built in two separate instalments, which have separate stairs and no communication with one another on the upper landing. These two rooms are supposed to be locked up and not in use at present, but I have secured their keys.”</p>
			<p>He unlocked one of the doors, and we entered the room. It was square, and of quite a fair size. On two sides the walls sloped attic-wise, in a third was a fireplace and a window, and in the fourth two doors⁠—the second opening into a large cupboard. This room had simple bedroom furniture, and also a small table and a basket chair. When we entered, it was lit only by a good fire, and pervaded by a pleasant aroma of peat smoke. Tiel lighted a paraffin lamp and remarked⁠—</p>
			<p>“You ought to be quite comfortable here.”</p>
			<p>Personally, I confess that my breath was fairly taken away. I had anticipated sleeping under the roof in some dark and chilly garret, or perhaps in the straw of an outhouse.</p>
			<p>“Comfortable!” I exclaimed. “<i xml:lang="de">Mein Gott</i>, who would not be on secret service! But are you sure all this is safe? This fire, for instance⁠—the smoke surely will be seen.”</p>
			<p>“I have promised to keep the bedrooms aired while I am staying here,” smiled Tiel.</p>
			<p>He then explained in detail the arrangements of our remarkable household. He himself slept in the front part of the house, up the other staircase. The room opposite mine was empty, and so was the room underneath; but below the other was the kitchen, and I was warned to be very quiet in my movements. The single servant arrived early in the morning, and left about nine o’clock at night: she lived, it seemed, at a neighbouring farm; and Tiel assured me there was nothing to be feared from her provided I was reasonably careful.</p>
			<p>I had brought with me a razor, a toothbrush, and a brush and comb, and Tiel had very thoughtfully brought a spare sleeping suit and a pair of slippers. I was not at all sure that I was disposed to like the man, but I had to admit that his thoroughness and his consideration for my comfort were highly praiseworthy. In fact, I told him so frankly, and we parted for the night on friendly terms.</p>
			<p>Tiel quietly descended the stairs, while I sat down before my fire and smoked a last cigarette, and then very gratefully turned into my comfortable bed.</p>
